      <br><br>I started researching about Happiness through my recent outrage over the perceived evils of the money-market system as presented in the three part film series ZEITGEIST (2007-2011 original releases; Zeitgeistmovie.com, https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1166827/).
      American creator/activist Joseph Peters (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Joseph">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Joseph</a>)

      <br><br>had partnered from ~2008–2012 with self-described futurist and social engineer Jacque Fresco, also American, (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacque_Fresco">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacque_Fresco</a>)
      <br><br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*9GHhabfRzu3ybHPup_-Opg.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%">
      <br><br>to envision and advocate for humanity/Earth, a healthier, and hopefully HAPPIER, future. One extant model affiliated with Fresco, et al is <a href="https://www.thevenusproject.com/">https://www.thevenusproject.com/</a>
      <br><br>In short, they illustrate how rampant global societal ills evolved through institutions such as Religion and Government into what they coin the current “Money-Market System” of economics. They promote a replacement of this failing, manipulatively ludicrous system with a “Resource-Based Economy,” (https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Resource-Based_Economy?fbclid=IwAR0QKeX5AZOB6vHuA5by8Z7xI-XGxGHNjsf5ao8VGpIkpBj6eySzrpnKVCY)where many, if not all world problems- eg, of health, poverty, pollution, etc- would be eradicated.
      <br><br>The backbone of this seemingly possible Utopia revolves around a global sea change of cultural ideas, from idealized urban planning and reliance upon technological advancements to foremost, a dismantling of said fixtures such as all Banking networks world-wide.
      <br><br>Detractors aside, a plethora of medical doctors, PhD scientists, economists, etc, are extensively interviewed/mined for their expert views/knowledge.
      <br><br>This triptych documentary overall has been helpful to my personal development, (and future plannings) my then pre-teen angst-ridden musings always returning to Buddha’s observations and questionings of WHY PEOPLE (especially adults) OFTEN SEEM SO DEPRESSED & ANXIOUS (as opposed to the opposite.)
      <br><br>Despite any critical derisions of cheesiness (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iis19U2x5YI">trailer</a>) or apparent emotional sensationalism (conspiracy theories unfortunately, but understandably open the first part) Zeitgeist has received, publicly, it enjoys (according to wikipedia,) a kind of “cultish” following among Optimists possessing a STRONG URGE to empower themselves and others through AWARENESS EDUCATION…Activists whose goals are to uPLIFT their World communities; PROBLEM SOLVE/FIX THINGS. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0vhnEN2w_U&t=108s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0vhnEN2w_U&t=108s</a>

      <br><br>I found a <b>“World Happiness Report 2019”</b> (<a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2019/">https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2019/</a>) expansive dataset with discussions simply Go0gLing.
      <br><br>I’ve been curious about this decades new field of Psychology- The Science of Happiness. The more violence against self or others that media features, and as reference for my own journeys through life, the more I wanted to know whether these tragedies could have been prevented with Mental Healthcare. At the start, I framed my inquiries basically as
      <br><br><b>Research Questions:
      <br>1) How does one quantify and qualify “Happiness?”
      <br>2) Which are the Happiest countries?
      <br>3) What role does Money play in those countries’ self-assessed “Happiness levels?”</b>
      <br><br>The World Happiness Report is an annual survey that was first released in “…April 2012 in support of a UN High level meeting on “Wellbeing and Happiness: Defining a New Economic Paradigm”. That report presented the available global data on national happiness and reviewed related evidence from the emerging science of happiness, showing that the quality of people’s lives can be coherently, reliably, and validly assessed by a variety of subjective well-being measures, collectively referred to then and in subsequent reports as “happiness.”
      <br><br>Interestingly, that is the year Josephs and Fresco parted ways. 2019’s report focuses “…on happiness and the community: how happiness has evolved over the past dozen years, with a focus on the technologies, social norms, conflicts and government policies that have driven those changes.”
      <br><br><b>Cleaning, Exploring, Visualizing the Dataset</b>
      <br><br>To start, I <b>cleaned</b> the dataset by tallying NaN values using Python 3 in Colab. The columns consisted of the following:
      <br><br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1365/1*KxgIMY6SX9N1UuBQvGgh_w.png" style="max-width: 100%">
      <br><br>For the time being I decided to just drop Nulls in the dataframe (heretofore referred to as “df,” or a name containing “df”) or only use columns with relatively few Nulls.
      <br><br><b>Exploring</b>
      <br><br>I used <b>df.shape()</b> which <b>returned (1704, 26)</b> and then <b>df.head(1704)</b> to view the entire df with no truncated rows or columns.
      <br><br>I performed <b>pairplots</b> using Seaborn, to find + and — correlations within the df. I am having trouble getting the graphs to display without overlapping y axes. Shortening the column names helped with the Y axes labels, but made the graphs too tiny.
      <br><br>I will try to resolve the issue with a “tight layout” approach, per
      <br><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34179089/plt-tight-layout-with-sns-clustermap">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34179089/plt-tight-layout-with-sns-clustermap</a> & <a href="https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/tutorials/intermediate/tight_layout_guide.html">https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/tutorials/intermediate/tight_layout_guide.html</a>
      <br><br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2705/1*ucCgTT9B00JPlUvPtKP3pw.png" style="max-width: 100%">
      <br><br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1710/1*Jz87-tDc_nRMRe-KCtNSWQ.png" style="max-width: 100%">
      <br><br>Alternatively, I did an additional <b>correlation heatmap</b> for this reason. The lighter colored areas seem to show a greater correlation, between, for example, Healthy life expectancy at birth, and Social support (0.6 < x < 0.9). So, presumably, the more social support one has from one’s community, the longer one may live.
      <br><br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1553/1*J3u4x77vxJwF9m_V_cURbw.png" style="max-width: 100%">
      <br><br>Next I did <b>df.corr()</b> to augment/make more legible these findings.
      <br><br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2793/1*qs3XQX1QoQl7z-hO79G8zQ.png" style="max-width: 100%">
      <br><br>A few <b>Positive Correlations</b> include the aforementioned <b>Healthy life expectancy at birth</b> &
      <br>1. <b>Social support</b> (0.6) 2. <b>Positive affect</b> (0.3) 3. <b>Democratic Quality</b> (0.6) 4. <b>Generosity</b> (0.04)
      <br><br>A few <b>Negative Correlations</b> include <b>Healthy life expectancy at birth</b> &
      <br>1. <b>Perceptions of corruption</b> (-0.3) 2. <b>Negative affect</b> (-0.1) 3. <b>Confidence in national government</b> (-0.2 )
      <br><br>Correlations with <b>Healthy life expectancy at birth</b> & Aspects of National Economic Statuses were <b>all Negative Correlations as well</b>:
      <br><br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1585/1*bsCXL4diQTI2cRSEzU8Dfg.png" style="max-width: 100%">
      <br><br>1. GINI index (World Bank estimate) (-0.2)
      <br>2. GINI index (World Bank estimate) (-0.3)
      <br>3. average 2000–16 GINI of household income reported in Gallup, by wp5-year (-0.4)
      <br><br>I interpret this to generally mean that, eg, the greater the economic inequality that exists within a country, the shorter life expectancy a citizen of that country may have.
      <br><br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1803/1*u5zlXY8mRlFtuEOQTgBqFQ.png" style="max-width: 100%">
      <br><br>This gave me some preliminary insight into how Financial systems can adversely affect Happiness on a broad level, and as promulgated by Zeitgeist.
      <br><br><b>Visualizing the Data</b>
      <br><br>To glean more insight into the vast Happiness Report, and Happiness, I feature engineered a “Happiness Indicator” obtaining the average of these 7 columns; i reiterate that I dropped all rows with NaNs in them, as well as columns related to Economics, namely the 3 involving the GINI indices :
      <br><br>df2['Happiness Indicator'] = (df2['Social support'] + df2['Healthy life expectancy at birth'] + df2['Freedom to make life choices'] + df2['Generosity'] + df2['Positive affect'] + df2['Confidence in national government'] + df2['Democratic Quality'])/7 # averaging 7 cols
